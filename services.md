Services

The server hosts three websites at the moment:

- systerserver.net
- eclectictechcarnival.org
- marieta.org

We want to concentrate on hosting services and not data. As such we host a “pad” service, run by etherpad-lite. This is a wonderful real-time, collaborative writing tool.

In the past we offered an conference call service using Freeswitch and sipml5. It worked! You could call a friend or host a group chap via the web interface. It is not installed atm; we are considering installing Mumble instead.
